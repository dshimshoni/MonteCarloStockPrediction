## Monte Carlo Stock Prediction

Monte Carlo Stock Prediction is a personal quantitative finance project focusing on the exploration and application of the Monte Carlo simulation method for stock price prediction. This project aims to provide a practical framework for understanding and simulating the dynamics of stock prices using statistical and computational techniques.

### Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Monte Carlo simulation for predicting stock prices. The project adopts a quantitative approach, leveraging statistical models to estimate the future price distribution of a given stock based on historical data.
#### Key Features:

* Statistical Analysis: Employs statistical tests to determine whether stock returns follow a log-normal distribution and adjusts the simulation approach accordingly.
* Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulates multiple scenarios of future stock price paths based on estimated parameters from historical data.
* Parameter Estimation: Utilizes historical stock data to estimate parameters such as the mean and standard deviation of stock returns.
* Visualization: Includes visual representations of the simulated stock price paths and comparisons with actual historical data.

### Installation and Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, and yfinance.
3. Open the Quantitative Monte Carlo Stock Simulation Project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis and view the simulation results.
